This forked copy of BotHack simply makes it easier on me to restore BotHack on my system in the future.

1. Go into your home root directory (cd ~).
2. Type: git clone https://github.com/we6jbo/BotHack
3. Type: chmod +x BotHack/we6jbo-launcher.sh
4. Open Startup Applications
5. Add the following: /home/we6jbo/BotHack/we6jbo-launcher.sh

Now BotHack should run when your computer reboots.
